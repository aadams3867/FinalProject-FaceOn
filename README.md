# FinalProject-FaceOn

#### Using the power of facial recognition to log in to Facebook more securely.

Much like fingerprint identification or phone number verification, facial recognition can provide another layer of security to verify that your login is valid, but faster and with less hassle.

If there's time, I'll add a mini facial-recognition game.
